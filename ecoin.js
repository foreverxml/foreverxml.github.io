Most Internet servers are powered on fossil fuels. And, external resources (CDNs, .css files, etc.) make this worse as there <b>is a seperate request for each one of them!</b> This is why I reccomend an extension called Decentraleyes that stores popular CDN contents on your computer to inject them without reaching out to any server. It works really well, and helps make less requests to fossil-fuel servers.<br><br>This reason, slowing carbon depletion of the Earth, even just by a little bit, is why all of my site pages come with in-built CSS and JS, not from external sources, and it's exactly why this site variation was made. Instead of traditional page loading, where another whole HTML file is fetched, this page stores body HTMLs in a JS variable, and loads them instead of using a whole new HTML file. Hence, you stay on the page and you get new content. Perfect way to ecoify your browsing!</span>",

    <span class='dsc'>Not everything is eco (ugh) but you can try to make everything more eco, with 5 extensions. Yes, it's that simple! (4 if you're on Chrome, sorry.) Here are the extensions: <ul><li>uBlock Origin: Trackers are all; over the web and they make tons of requests. Block these requests and save your bandwidth with uBlock Origin. <a href='https://ublockorigin.com/' target='_blank'>Get it here. <span class='mdi' style='font-size: 11px;'>open_in_new</span></a></li><li>Privacy Badger: Intelligent tracker blocker, blocks what uBlock Origin doesn't. <a href='https://privacybadger.org/' target='_blank'>Get it here. <span class='mdi' style='font-size: 11px;'>open_in_new</span></a></li><li>Facebook Container (Firefox only): Blocks ALL Facebook, such as "Sign in with Facebook" and "Like on Facebook" with no hassle. <a href='https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container/' target='_blank'>Get it here for Firefox. <span class='mdi' style='font-size: 11px;'>open_in_new</span></a></li><li>Decentraleyes: Injects CDN resources locally to prevent trackers, saving bandwidth. <a href='https://decentraleyes.org/' target='_blank'>Get it here. <span class='mdi' style='font-size: 11px;'>open_in_new</span></a></li><li>Ecosia Search (extension not needed): Search and plant trees: 42 searches plants a tree, and each search removes 1 kg of CO2 from the air. <a href='https://ecosia.org/' target='_blank'>Start eco-searching here. <span class='mdi' style='font-size: 11px;'>open_in_new</span></a></li></ul>But before you use these for all of your web needs, remember: <b>Program before web.</b> Try to use a program (LibreOffice) instead of a Web-based app (Google Docs/Slides/Sheets). Now have fun with your eco-browser!</span>"
